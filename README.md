# Literal

Literal is a textual annotation management system.

Literal is agnostic about _where and how_ you currently read text, and supports annotations made within a web browser, PDF reader, Kindle, and more.

## Why

Within the context of individual reading, your annotations are of equal or greater value than the text itself. Interacting with text elevates the reading experience beyond one of passive consumption and into one that requires analysis and critical thought.

Within the context of social reading, annotations magnify the impact of static text by enabling an ongoing and collaborative process of contextualization and analysis by a community. Diverse individual perspectives form necessarily diverse impressions of same piece of text, and enabling the circulation of those impressions in a structured way increases the overall experience for the entire community. Book clubs are an offline structure for this. 

## How It Works

To add an annotation to Literal:

1. Highlight the text.
2. Screenshot the highlight.
3. Share the screenshot to the Literal mobile application.

Literal will parse the screenshot to text, associate metadata with it, and it to your library. You can optionally associate additional metadata with the highlight, like an annotation. Literal does its best to determine the original source of the highlight, but you may have to help it out.

Your highlights form your library within Literal. Your highlights can be searched, organized, and shared with others. You can export your data at any time.
